ECS Task Definition Networking:
================================

    3 types of Networking Modes:

        - bridge
        - host
        - awsvpc
        - none

    
    bridge:
    -------

        - Task uses Docker's built-in virtual Network
        - Every container will get its own IP Address

        - If the network mode is bridge, the task utilized the Docker's built-in virtual network which runs inside each container instance


    
    awsvpc:
    -------

        - Each task has its own ENI
        - Achieves Network Isolation
        - Security groups gets attached at the container level
        - Each container will get its own security groups

    none:
    -----

        - Disables all Networking
        - IP for the container not configured
        - No access to the external networks as well as the other containers
        - Has the loopback Address

        If the network mode is none, the task's containers do not have external connectivity and port mappings can't be specified in the task Definition

    
    host:
    -----

        - Shares the host's network stack
        - ENI and security group gets attached to the EC2 level
        - Tasks bypasses Docker virtual network and maps container ports to the EC2 instance network interface
