ECS Features:
=============

    Features of Amazon ECS:
    -----------------------

    - Regional Service
    - Create a cluster within a new or Existing VPC
    - Define task definitions and services that specify which Docker container images to run across your clusters
    - Container images are stored in and pulled from container registries

    Containers and Images:
    ----------------------

    - To deploy applications on Amazon ECS, your application components must be architected to run in containers.
    - A Docker container contains everything that your software application needs to run.
    - Containers are created from a read only template called Images
    - Images are typically built from DockerFile
    - These Images are Stored in a Registry from which they can be downloaded and run on your cluster.
    

        DockerFile => Docker Image => Docker Registry (Amazon ECR, DockerHub)

    
    Task Definition:
    ================

        - To prepare your application to run on Amazon ECS, you create a task definition
        - The task definition is a text file, in JSON format, that describes one or more containers, up to a maximum of ten, that form your application.
        - Blueprint for your application
    
    Task Definition using Fargate launch type:
    ------------------------------------------

    {
        "family": "webserver",
        "containerDefinitions": [
            {
                "name": "web",
                "image": "nginx",
                "memory": "100",
                "cpu": "99"
            },
        ],
        "requiresCompatibilities": [
            "FARGATE"
        ],
        "networkMode": "awsvpc",
        "memory": "512",
        "cpu": "256",
    }

    Task and Scheduling:
    ====================

        - Task is an instantiation of the task definition within a cluster
        - Once you create a TD for your app in ECS, you can specify the number of tasks that will run on the cluster

        - Each task with Fargate launch type has own isolation boundary  and doesn't share the underlying

            - Kernel
            - CPU Resources
            - memory Resources
            - Elastic Network Interface

    Cluster:
    ========

        - Regional Service
        - Logical grouping of Resources
        - Fargate launch type - ECS manages cluster Resources (Pricier)
        - EC2 launch type - you manage the container instances (Cheaper)
        - Container instance = EC2 instance + ECS Container agent


    Container Agent:
    ----------------

        - Runs inside each resource within an ECS Cluster
        - Send info about resource's current running tasks and resource utilization to ECS.
        - Start/stop tasks when it receives a request from ECS.
