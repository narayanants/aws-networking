* For VPC, choose the VPC that you created earlier.
* For Availability Zone, choose a different Availability Zone than your original subnets in the VPC.
* For IPv4 CIDR block, enter a valid CIDR block. For example, the wizard creates CIDR blocks in 10.0.0.0/24 and 10.0.1.0/24 by default. You could use 10.0.3.0/24 for your second private subnet.

* For VPC, choose the VPC that you created earlier.
* For Availability Zone, choose the same Availability Zone as the additional private subnet that you created in the previous procedure.
