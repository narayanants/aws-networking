VPC Overview and Hands On:
==========================

 - VPC - Virtual Private Cloud
 - Multiple VPC per Region (Max 5)
 - Max CIDR per VPC is 5. For each CIDR
    - Min Size => /28 = 16 IP
    - Max Size => /16 = 65536 IP
- Only Private IP ranges are allowed

    10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8) => Big Networks => Private Networks
    172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12) => Default AWS One
    192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16) => Home Networks

- VPC should not overlap with other Networks
