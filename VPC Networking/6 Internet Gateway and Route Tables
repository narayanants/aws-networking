Internet Gateway and Route Tables (IGW)
=================================

    - Public Subnet - Enable Auto Assign Public IPs
    - IGW Connect VPC to Internet
    - Scales Horizontally and is HA and redundant
    - Must be created separately from VPC
    - One VPC = 1 IGW and vice versa
    - IGW is also NAT for instances in the public IPv4
    - On their own doesn't allow internet access
    - Route tables are to be edited


    - Public Route Table
    - Private Route Table

    - Public Route Table - 0.0.0.0/0 => IGW
